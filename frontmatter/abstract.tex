\acrfull{shs} have been used as a solution for electrifying households in rural off-grid areas for decades. The share of the worlds population living in off-grid areas have been steadily declining, reducing the need for SHS. This thesis looks at the use of these systems in high grid coverage developing countries. Following up a SHS project in Albania, we look at the economical and social benefits of using these systems as humanitarian aid. Interviews and observations show that receivers of SHS take great care of them, and utilize their capacity. The results suggest that there is little economic benefits of these systems, but several social benefits of the systems. Mostly the use of the systems as a backup during power outages is valued by the participants.
