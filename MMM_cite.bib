One emerging business model in such locations, which aims to maintain affordability and access for customers with severe liquidity constraints, is the Pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) approach to solar home system (SHS) sales. This study focuses on the socioeconomic impacts of PAYGO SHS that are currently being marketed by a private supplier in the Amhara region of Ethiopia. The study employs descriptive and propensity score matching analysis to examine a range of impacts on those adopting this technology. The use of PAYGO SHS is shown to have no discernible impact on household income, but it does reduce monthly energy expenditure. Use of a PAYGO SHS also allows school-aged children to extend their study hours into the night, improves the self-reported health of family members, allows women to reallocate their time across various activities, and enhances perceived safety and security. The role of SHS in financial inclusion and access to information is also discussed. Achieving wider dissemination of SHS to target populations will require more appropriate and effective intervention and marketing effort.},

Ever increasing demand–supply gap, crumbling electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure, high cost of delivered electricity are a few of these. Use of renewable energy technologies for meeting basic energy needs of rural communities has been promoted by the Governments world over for many decades. Photovoltaic (PV) technology is one of the first among several renewable energy technologies that was adopted globally as well as in India for meeting basic electricity needs of rural areas that are not connected to the grid. This paper attempts at reviewing and analyzing PV literature pertaining to decentralized rural electrification into two main categories—(1) experiences from rural electrification and technology demonstration programmes covering barriers and challenges in marketing and dissemination; institutional and financing approaches; and productive and economic applications, (2) techno-economic aspects including system design methodologies and approaches; performance evaluation and monitoring; techno-economic comparison of various systems; and environmental implications and life cycle analysis.

  date = {2018},
  abstract = {The astounding scope of the global energy poverty challenge has motivated many organizations to promote solar energy for lighting, heating, and cooking needs in off-grid settings. However, poorly designed or executed projects have the potential to cause unnecessary harm in communities lacking access to reliable energy. We identify and analyze the enabling environment that drives or blocks the diffusion, dissemination, and adoption of solar products, home systems, lanterns, hot water heaters, and cooking products in low- and middleincome countries (LMICs). To address this question, we conducted a systematic review to examine which factors support or complicate household solar adoption. We identified 42 studies in 26 countries that describe the enabling environment: the constellation of financial, market, programmatic, and regulatory factors that lead to adoption of small-scale solar systems. At the household level, the cost of technology and quality of a product have the potential to greatly impact the success of a program. On a programmatic scale, customer support and ongoing maintenance have the potential to increase sustainable use of products. Finally, supportive governmentlevel policies and design standards can encourage the growth of high-quality products in regional markets. This complex and interconnected system can either drive increases in households transitioning from harmful fuel use to renewable energy or discourage communities from adopting the equipment under consideration. However, the small sample size and the glaring gaps in categories represented tell us that much more research is needed to fully understand this picture. The experiences documented in the literature describe complex programmatic, financial, and regulatory challenges that must be addressed in order to provide the rural energy poor with services for lighting, heating, and cooking.},

  abstract = {Around 20\% of the world’s population currently do not have access to electricity while the importance of electricity services for society continues to increase. Solar Home Systems (SHS) are a competitive option for supplying basic electrification under meteorological conditions in Sunbelt countries. However, many of the SHS electrification programmes have failed in the past. Furthermore, their evaluation is often still based on one individual indicator such as the number of disseminated systems. This research explores how to measure success of SHSs in a comprehensive manner. Success can be defined as the achievement of self-set goals. From this statement a model of success was developed which incorporates all keystakeholders and their multiple self-set goals. The model of success combines the individual level of success with the SHS implementation’s overall success. A hypothetical example is used to demonstrate the application of the model. The challenges relating to the measurement of success are also illustrated. The resulting methodology combines general success factor research, diffusion of innovation research, and lessons learned from SHS projects. The drawbacks of the current approaches to SHS implementation, and their characteristic of still being an innovation, were also determined. The proposed model of success can be applied to pre-evaluate SHS programmes, to evaluate existing SHS projects, and to observe and evaluate the development of SHS implementation over time.},

Mathematical models have been used to take into account shallow-angle reflectivity, spectral sensitivity, dependence of module efficiency on irradiance and module temperature as well as how the module temperature depends on irradiance, ambient temperature and wind speed. Spectrally resolved irradiance data retrieved from satellite images are combined with temperature and wind speed data from global computational weather forecast data to produce maps of PV performance for Eurasia and Africa. Results show that module reflectivity causes a fairly small drop of 2\%–4\% in PV performance. Spectral effects may modify the performance by up to ±6\%, depending on location and module type. The strongest effect is seen in the dependence on irradiance and module temperature, which may range from −20\% to +5\% at different locations.},

In spite of high expectations from the development of indigenous renewable energy resources using nonconventional approaches (wind power, wave power, ocean thermal energy conversion, biogas digestors, biomass gasiÆers), these technologies have largely failed to develop into viable alternatives to conventional approaches (based on imported petroleum, biomass and hydroelectric power). Among the few exceptions are solar photovoltaic power for remote islands, especially when provided through a utility type institution, solar water heaters, and the use of biomass wastes by agroindustries. As a result, all the island countries are still heavily dependent on fossil fuels for their energy requirements. Some of them to such an extent that their petroleum imports are up to 500\% of their total exports.},

The key challenges, future trends as well as promising data-science technologies to further improve this research field are discussed. As battery full-lifespan (manufacturing, operation, and reutilization) management is a hot research topic in both energy and AI fields and none specific book has focused on systematically describing this particular from a data science perspective before, this book can attract the attention of academics, scientists, engineers, and practitioners. It is useful as a reference book for students and graduates working in related fields. Specifically, the audience could not only get the basics of battery manufacturing, operation, and reutilization but also the information of related data-science technologies. The step-by-step guidance, comprehensive introduction, and case studies to the topic make it accessible to audiences of different levels, from graduates to experienced engineers},

Indonesia is benefited from abundant solar radiation levels, yet the utilization of solar energy as one possible solution is still very limited. The non-optimal use of this eco-friendly energy needs to be investigated by examining consumers’ intention to adopt Solar House System (SHS) technology along with factors affecting it. This study used Behavioral Reasoning Theory (BRT) that consists of values, reasons for adoption, reasons against adoption, attitude, and social influence as variables to predict adoption intention. Further, Partial Least Square Modeling was used to test the hypotheses after collecting 428 data by distributing questionnaires in Bandung Area. The result reveals that social influence plays the most significant role in predicting SHS adoption intention, attitude, reasons for adoption, and values. Thus, this study extends our understanding of the attitude-behavior gap in the context of green technology and the impact of social influence.},

The prevailing concept for sample size in qualitative studies is “saturation.” Saturation is closely tied to a specific methodology, and the term is inconsistently applied. We propose the concept “information power” to guide adequate sample size for qualitative studies. Information power indicates that the more information the sample holds, relevant for the actual study, the lower amount of participants is needed. We suggest that the size of a sample with sufficient information power depends on (a) the aim of the study, (b) sample specificity, (c) use of established theory, (d) quality of dialogue, and (e) analysis strategy. We present a model where these elements of information and their relevant dimensions are related to information power. Application of this model in the planning and during data collection of a qualitative study is discussed.},

  abstract = {Many developing countries in Africa face a “double tragedy” when it comes to electrification. Electricity access rates are low, while those who have access to electricity face frequent outages. There are ongoing efforts aimed at increasing access to electricity on the continent. However, the need to improve the reliability of electricity supply receives limited attention. Unreliable electricity impacts users by limiting electricity utilization and the benefits that should accrue from having an electricity connection. Using data from 496 household survey questionnaires, this study examines the impacts of electricity outages in urban households in Accra, Ghana. The study applies correlation and regression analyses to identify which household characteristics are associated with or predict households reporting outage impacts. Outages were found to impact household safety/security, access to food, and access to social services and were found to cause appliance damage as well. Factors that are significantly correlated with reporting certain outage impacts include respondent’s annual income and employment status, frequency of electricity outages, and household size. Significant predictors of reporting outage impacts are socioeconomic disadvantage, high exposure to outages, and living in a large family setting. The study’s findings underscore the need for interventions to eliminate, or at least minimize, electricity supply interruptions in developing countries if sustainable social and economic development is to be achieved.},

This article details a multi-year cycling study of commercial LiFePO               4               (LFP), LiNi               x               Co               y               Al               1−x−y               O               2               (NCA), and LiNi               x               Mn               y               Co               1−x−y               O               2               (NMC) cells, varying the discharge rate, depth of discharge (DOD), and environment temperature. The capacity and discharge energy retention, as well as the round-trip efficiency, were compared. Even when operated within manufacturer specifications, the range of cycling conditions had a profound effect on cell degradation, with time to reach 80\% capacity varying by thousands of hours and cycle counts among cells of each chemistry. The degradation of cells in this study was compared to that of similar cells in previous studies to identify universal trends and to provide a standard deviation for performance. All cycling files have been made publicly available at batteryarchive.org, a recently developed repository for visualization and comparison of battery data, to facilitate future experimental and modeling efforts.},

  abstract = {There is a paucity of data on energy access in refugee camps and limited analysis regarding the viability of modern energy technologies such as solar home systems in these contexts. This paper addresses these by presenting an overview of the household and small enterprise electricity access situation in Kigeme, Nyabiheke and Gihembe camps in Rwanda and through the application of a Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal and Environmental (PESTLE) analysis to assess the barriers influencing solar home system provision. Most households and small enterprises currently have limited or no access to electricity and there is significant unmet demand for energy services such as mobile phone charging, lighting, and entertainment in the camps. The analysis suggests that solar home systems can meet these energy needs and identifies important factors in ensuring projects are successful. Projects should be informed by the needs and priorities of end-users and should be aligned with national policies, such as achieving Tier 2 energy access, to garner political support. Where possible, local market systems should be nurtured to normalise paying for energy products and to avoid free distribution. This can support private sector engagement and result in longer system lifetimes through improved maintenance. Energy literacy programmes can also improve awareness of solar home systems and their benefits compared to traditional sources of energy. These findings can inform practitioners on the supporting policy/ financial frameworks, design requirements and implementation measures needed to maximise the benefits of future solar home system projects and help achieve electrification targets.},

Yin's bestselling text provides a complete portal to the world of case study research. With the integration of 11 applications in this edition, the book gives readers access to exemplary case studies drawn from a wide variety of academic and applied fields. Ultimately, Case Study Research and Applications will guide students in the successful design and use of the case study research method. New to this Edition Includes 11 in-depth applications that show how researchers have implemented case study methods successfully. Increases reference to relativist and constructivist approaches to case study research, as well as how case studies can be part of mixed methods projects. Places greater emphasis on using plausible rival explanations to bolster case study quality. Discusses synthesizing findings across case studies in a multiple-case study in more detail Adds an expanded list of 15 fields that have text or texts devoted to case study research. Sharpens discussion of distinguishing research from non-research case studies. The author brings to light at least three remaining gaps to be filled in the future: how rival explanations can become more routinely integrated into all case study research; the difference between case-based and variable-based approaches to designing and analyzing case studies; and the relationship between case study research and qualitative research},
